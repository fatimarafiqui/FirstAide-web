### Abstract
Sexual assault and rape are serious social and public health issues, being one of the major cause of concern. FirstAide-Web is a web based application developed to help the PCV(Peace Corps Volunteers), in case of sexual harassment. National surveys by the United Nations estimate that one in every six women has experienced an attempt to rape at some time or the other. The vast majority of women are sexually assaulted by men with whom they are acquainted. Women are far less likely to report a rape or assault when they know their assailant, thus instance of sexual assaults are greatly under-reported. The FirstAide web app ensures safety by sending messages to fellow volunteers, helpline numbers etc. when in trouble. This application makes it a point that the victim can be sure of getting all the help he/she needs in case of a critical situation. The sexually assaulted volunteer can get information of Peace Corps policy and safety procedures and also contact Peace Corps for help.FirstAide is an application which helps the victims of Sexual Assault. The project will be useful for the Peace Corps Volunteers and 'Systers' is developing it for them. The peace corps volunteers are constantly at the peril as they travel individually to many remote areas. This app comes to the rescue if they sense any trouble. There is a provision to send emergency messages to their comrades in one click. The volunteer can be prepared to handle any unwanted situation using the app. However, if the unfortunate happens then, the victim can be sure to get all the help needed. The helplines can be called directly using the call and SMS feature and the doubts can be cleared if any. There is also information provided regarding the safety and reporting procedures.
